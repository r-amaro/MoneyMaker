# MoneyMaker
A C# program that converts an initial amount of U.S. cents into the most efficient combination of coins (pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters).

MoneyMaker is inspired by Codecademy, created by Rafael Amaro.

Developed on Microsoft Visual Studio - Community 2017.

Inside of the MoneyMaker folder, the Program.cs file is where the source code is located.
